# NoShowAppointment_Analysis
This is analysis on a piece of data on excel sheet that shows the patients who are shown and not shown on their appointment, using some data on every patient like if he had diabetes, if he is alchoholic or not, has handicap or not, his Neighbourhood,...
using some questions I made some analysis using python and jupitar notebook
Steps are:
Data Cleaning
Question 1(do people who didn't receive an sms didn't come to their appointment?)
Question 2 (Is handicap has something to do with missing the appointment)
